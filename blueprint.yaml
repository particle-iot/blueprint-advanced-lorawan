introduction: |
  Quickstart blueprint demonstrating how to use the LoRa radio on the Muon
  with the M-SoM M.2 module as host. It walks through initialization,
  network join, and message transmission using LoRaWAN.

  This tutorial shows how to configure and use the LoRaWAN stack on the
  Particle Muon. The firmware initializes the radio, sets up LoRaWAN keys,
  joins the network, and transmits sample messages. It provides a reference
  for developers looking to build long-range, low-power IoT solutions
  using Particle hardware.
